##Instructions

###Preparation for baking
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
1. Grease the base of 3 20cm cake tins.  (We use 2x cake tins of unknown diameter)
1. Line the tins with baking parchment.

###Section 1 - Creating chocolate mixture
1. Boil the kettle
1. Put the butter and 75g of chocolate, broken into chunks, into a small pan and gently heat, while stirring, until completely melted.

###Section 2 - Making cake batter
1. Mix together the flour, sugar, cocoa, and bicarbonate of soda with a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl.
1. Whisk the eggs and buttermilk (or yogurt if substituted) together.
1. Scrape the melted chocolate mixture and the egg mixture into the dry Ingredients.
1. Add 100ml boiling water and mix/whisk briefly with an electric whisk until the cake batter is lump free.

###Section 3 - Baking the cakes
1. Divide the mixture between the tins.
1. Bake for 25 minutes, swapping the tins after 20 minutes *if* they're on different shelves.
1. To test if they're done, push in a skewer and check that it comes out clean.

###Section 4 - After-baking cake operations
1. Prick the cakes with a skewer.  Note: The pricking should be done shallowly and repeatedly over the entire surface of the cakes in order to prepare the surface to accept the kirsch.
1. Mix together 2 tbsp of cherry juice and the kirsch (or more juice instead).
1. Drizzle the mixture over the cakes.
1. Cool the cakes.
