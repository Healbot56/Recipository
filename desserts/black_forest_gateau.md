##Instructions

###Preparation for baking
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
1. Grease the base of 3 20cm cake tins.  ```(We use 2x cake tins of unknown diameter)```
1. Line the tins with baking parchment.

###Section 1 - Creating chocolate mixture
1. Boil the kettle
1. Put the butter and 75g of chocolate, broken into chunks, into a small pan and gently heat, while stirring, until completely melted.

###Section 2 - Making cake batter
1. Mix together the flour, sugar, cocoa, and bicarbonate of soda with a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl.
1. Whisk the eggs and buttermilk (or yogurt if substituted) together.
1. Scrape the melted chocolate mixture and the egg mixture into the dry Ingredients.
1. Add 100ml boiling water and mix/whisk briefly with an electric whisk until the cake batter is lump free.

###Section 3 - Baking the cakes
1. Divide the mixture between the tins.
1. Bake for 25 minutes, swapping the tins after 20 minutes if they're on different shelves.
1. To test if they're done, push in a skewer and check that it comes out clean.

###Section 4 - After-baking cake operations
1. Prick the cakes with a skewer.  Note: The pricking should be done shallowly and repeatedly over the entire surface of the cakes in order to prepare the surface to accept the kirsch.
1. Mix together 2 tbsp of cherry juice and the kirsch (or use more juice instead of kirsch).  ```Note: We use 1 tbsp kirsch MAX and use cherry juice for the rest```
1. Drizzle the mixture over the cakes.
1. Cool the cakes.

###Section 5 - Making components to assemble the cakes with
1. Mix together the drained cherries and jam.
1. Tip 200ml of the cream into a small pan and heat until just below simmering point.
1. Chop the remaining chocolate and put in a heatproof bowl.
1. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until melted. ```NOTE: We instead put the chocolate into a pot, add the cream, and heat on the stove.```
1. Set aside until spreadable.

###Section 6 - Assembling and topping the cakes
Once the cakes are cool:

1. Whisk the remaining cream and the powdered sugar together until softly whipped.
1. Spread the frosting over two of the cakes.
1. Spoon on the jammy cherries & jam mixture.
1. Stack the cakes together.
1. Spread the chocolate cream over the third cake.
1. Place the third cake on top of the other cakes.
1. (If desired), pile the fresh cherries in and around the cake.
1. Serve.

```Note: We put frosting and cherries on the bottom cake.  Then we put the top cake on top.  Then we put the chocolate coating on top.  Then we put the frosting on top.```
