<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Preparation for baking</h3>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
<li>Grease the base of 3 20cm cake tins.  (We use 2x cake tins of unknown diameter)</li>
<li>Line the tins with baking parchment.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Section 1 - Creating chocolate mixture</h3>

<ol>
<li>Boil the kettle</li>
<li>Put the butter and 75g of chocolate, broken into chunks, into a small pan and gently heat, while stirring, until completely melted.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Section 2 - Making cake batter</h3>

<ol>
<li>Mix together the flour, sugar, cocoa, and bicarbonate of soda with a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Whisk the eggs and buttermilk (or yogurt if substituted) together.</li>
<li>Scrape the melted chocolate mixture and the egg mixture into the dry Ingredients.</li>
<li>Add 100ml boiling water and mix/whisk briefly with an electric whisk until the cake batter is lump free.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Section 3 - Baking the cakes</h3>

<ol>
<li>Divide the mixture between the tins.</li>
<li>Bake for 25 minutes, swapping the tins after 20 minutes <em>if</em> they're on different shelves.</li>
<li>To test if they're done, push in a skewer and check that it comes out clean.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Section 4 - After-baking cake operations</h3>

<ol>
<li>Prick the cakes with a skewer.  Note: The pricking should be done shallowly and repeatedly over the entire surface of the cakes in order to prepare the surface to accept the kirsch.</li>
<li>Mix together 2 tbsp of cherry juice and the kirsch (or more juice instead).</li>
<li>Drizzle the mixture over the cakes.</li>
<li>Cool the cakes.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Section 5 - Assembling the cakes</h3>

<ol>
<li>Mix together the remaining drained cherries and jam.  Tip 200ml of the cream into a small pan and heat until just below simmering point.</li>
<li>Chop the remaining chocolate and put in a heatproof bowl.</li>
<li>Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until melted.</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: We instead put the chocolate into a pot, add the cream, and heat on the stove.</p>
